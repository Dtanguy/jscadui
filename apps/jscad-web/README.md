# JSCAD web app

This is the JSCAD web application hosted at https://jscad.app

If you want to discuss jscad or jscadui, please join us on discord: https://discord.gg/AaqGskur93

## Running Locally

You must install modules from root of the project because it uses npm workspaces.

After cloning the project, go to the root folder of the checked out jscadui repo. Then install npm dependencies by running:

```
npm i
```

To start the local development server, go to the `apps/jscad-web` directory and run:

```
npm start
```

## Deployment

To start the production server run:

```
npm run serve
```

# using url to load external script and CORS

If you want to share a script from your website you should setup CORS, and make sure to use HTTPS!

if you do not setup CORS [jscad.app](https://jscad.app) can fallback to `/remote` to download the script, but this workaround  may not be available forever (such enpoint could be abused to hide IP for attacks).


For hostings (that are uaually cheap and abundant) on CPanel adding .htaccess to your folder should work.
```
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "origin, x-requested-with, content-type"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "PUT, GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS"
</IfModule>
```

If you are using github you should be fine, as gists and github pages have those CORS headers.
